<h1>Things web service</h1>

<p>Implements Things monitoring services under a web microservice.</p>
<p>This module is part of the Things project and requires the Quarkus framework. We kept it in a separate module due to preserving library decoupling. As this implementation was not tested in native mode, we compile it under JDK 1.8.</p>
<p>To test its basic functionality, compile the project with the debug profile, and run it using the run-test script.</p>
